Tipsy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Zifeng Liang

Time spent: **8-9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Implemented Light/Dark Mode
- [x] Can Divide by the number of people

## Notes

I don't have any past experience using Xcode or Swift, so it was a pretty steep learning curve for me. I spent ~4 hours getting familiar with Swift and how to use Xcode using the provided resources. Another roadblock was that I got a "this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key" error that I wasn't able to debug, so I had to start over at the middle of my project. Despite the challenge, I implemented two additional features to my application.
